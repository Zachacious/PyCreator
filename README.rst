PyCreator
=========

Simple Python ide created for learning purposes. Uses PyQode and a special version of PyQt5 for Python 2.7(see here). Features full Python syntax highlighting, Jedi code completion, splittable code tabs, script out-liner, Frosted and Pep checkers as well as a fully drag 'n drop enabled file browser. That said, it still lacks alot of features present in other ides like virtual environment management, a debugger and Github integration.

Important!
----------

Pycreator is an experiment and is not meant for actual production use, however, pull request are welcome and I will do my best to answer any questions you may have.

To Do
-----

Upgrade to Python 3 and use a non-special Qt binding(official PyQt5). PySide would freeze the menu. Perhaps this is a PyQode issue?
