# PyCreator
Simple Python ide created for learning purposes. Uses PyQode and a special version of _PyQt5 for Python 2.7_([see here](http://abstractfactory.io/blog/pyqt5-1-1-for-python-2-7/)). Features Jedi code completion Frosted and pep checkers as well as a fully drag n' drop enabled file browser. That said, it still lacks alot of features present in other ides like virtual environment management and Github integration. 

### Important!
Pycreator is an **experiment** and is not meant for actual production use, however, pull request are welcome and I will do my best to answer any questions you may have.

### To Do
Upgrade to Python 3 and use a _non-special_ Qt binding(official PyQt5). PySide would freeze the menu.
Perhaps this is a PyQode issue?
